## Scrape the Data 

```{r}


page <- "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_nuclear_reactors"

# Extracting all tables
SetOfTables <- 
  page %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_nodes(css = "table") %>%
  html_table(fill = TRUE)


Japan <- SetOfTables[[21]]


Japan1 <-
  Japan %>%
  filter(row_number() > 1) %>%
  rename(name = Plantname, 
         reactor = UnitNo.,
         model = Model,
         status = Status, 
         netMW = `Capacity(MW)`,
         construction = Beginbuilding,
         operation = Commercialoperation, 
         closure = Closed) %>%
  mutate(
    netMW = as.numeric(netMW),
    construction = sub("25 Jan 2011[78]", "25 Jan 2011", construction),
    
    operation = dmy(operation))

```


## Your turn: In what ways is the table tidy? How is it not tidy? Whatâ€™s different about it from a tidy table?

My answer here..... 


## Your Turn: Plot Net Generation Capacity vs Construction Date

```{r}
#my code here 


```


## Your Turn: Scrape & Clean China Data (then merge with Japan)

```{r}
#my code here... 

```



## Your Turn: Reconstruct Info Graphic of Japan Reactors (or other country of interest)

```{r}
#My code here

```
